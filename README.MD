<b>Project description:</b><br>
I worked on data from MuscleHub gym. There was the A/B test for the new clients:<br>
Group A clients got a fitness test at first visit of gym, group B skipped the test<br>
Next step was filling an application and the last one (hopefully) purchasing.<br><br>
<b>I wanted to understand how a fitness test influenced the number of people purchased a membership in the MuscleHub Gym. </b><br>
<br>Following tasks completed:
* Checked the distribution of clients in A/B groups (the balance)
* Plotted funnels for different groups
* Checked if the difference is statistically significant between A/B groups, between other subgroups by Chi-square test
* Visualized the distridutions of applied and purchesed clients in different groups
* Implemented the function to generate the scheme (illustration) which groups are in current test
* Answered number of questions about the clients, as well tested additional hypothesis for gender subgroups
* Plotted p-values for all tested groups on final barchart for general conclusions

*All .csv files provided by Codacademy platform, from Projects in Data Science section*
