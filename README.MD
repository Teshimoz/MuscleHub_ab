Project description:<br>

We are working on data from MuscleHub Gym

There was an A/B test:<br>
Group A people get a fitness test at first visit of gym, group B skipped the test.<br>
Next step was filling an application and the last one (hopefully) purchasing.<br>
We want to understand how a fitness test influenced the number of people purchased a membership in the MuscleHub Gym.
